I was troubled to learn recently that:

<strong>1. NSERC awarded far fewer postdocs and grad student fellowships in 2011 vs. 2010.</strong>

The <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/FundingDecisions-DecisionsFinancement/ScholarshipsAndFellowships-ConcoursDeBourses/index_eng.asp?Year=2011">official statistics</a> reveal that NSERC awarded less than half the number of PDFs in 2011 than were awarded in 2010. Master's awards are down. Doctoral awards are down. NSERC communicated an <a href="http://nghoussoub.com/2011/07/26/nserc-explains-the-drop-in-2011-cgs-pgs-and-pdf-numbers/">official explanation</a> in reply to <a href="http://nghoussoub.com/2011/07/20/nsercs-scholarships-and-fellowships-policy-shift-or-collateral-damage/">N. Ghousshoub's post </a>on this news, but the numbers still trouble me.

<strong>2. NSERC staff appears to have reallocated funds across disciplines, without consultation.</strong>

In the past, changes to NSERC's investment strategy  took place in consultation with the academic scientific research community through reallocation exercises. NSERC President Suzanne Fortier's <a href="https://nmlc.math.ca/blogs/NSERC_Liaison_Committee/s-fortier-reply-2/">reply</a><em> </em> to the <a href="https://nmlc.math.ca/blogs/NSERC_Liaison_Committee/">public letter by the math/stats community </a>reports that the reallocation exercise was <em>"</em>determined to be very demanding with limited return<em>" </em>and has been discontinued. It is reassuring that the Ministry of Industry and NSERC have requested input from an <a href="http://www.scienceadvice.ca/en/assessments/in-progress/science-performance/expert-panel.aspx">expert panel</a> on<a href="http://www.scienceadvice.ca/en/assessments/in-progress/science-performance.aspx"> science performance and research funding</a>. It is unclear what role the report and recommendations from the expert panel will have on NSERC policies. What is clear, in light of the <a href="http://nghoussoub.com/2011/07/28/the-decline-in-discovery-grants-budgets-also-begs-for-an-explanation/">data assembled by N. Ghoussoub</a>, is that NSERC staff has substantially changed their investment portfolio across disciplines over the past five years.
