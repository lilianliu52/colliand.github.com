My former colleague <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~lguth/">Larry Guth</a> (now <a href="http://math.mit.edu/people/profile.php?pid=1461">at MIT</a>) visited us recently and gave a beautiful colloquium talk. The Department has recently deployed a video streaming service so we are able to share Larry's talk with the world. We look forward to sharing other videos in the future.

<h3>Unexpected applications of polynomials in combinatorics</h3>

<em>Abstract:</em>
In the last five years, several hard problems in combinatorics  have  been solved by using polynomials in an unexpected way. In some  cases,  the proofs are very short, and I will present a complete proof in  the  lecture. One of the problems is the joints problem. Given a set of   lines in $R^3$, a joint is a point that lies in three non-coplanar  lines.  Given $L$ lines in $R^3$, how many joints can there be? Another  problem is  the distinct distance problem in the plane. If P is a set of  points in  the plane, the distance set of $P$ is the set of all  distances from one  point of $P$ to another. If $P$ is a set of $N$  points in the plane, how small  can the distance set of $P$ be? The  proofs involve studying a set of  points in a vector space by finding a  polynomial of controlled degree  that vanishes at the points, and then  using the geometry of the zero-set  to understand the combinatorial  properties of the points. The goal for  the talk is to give an overview  of this new method.
