[Jennifer Berdahl](http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/viewFac.asp?facultyID=jberdahl) of the <a href="http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/index.html">Rotman School of Management</a> recently shared some slides with me that I thought should be more widely circulated among mathematicians. This presentation was created by MIT Professors <a href="http://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/~liskov/">Barbara Liskov </a>and <a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/yates.html">JoAnne Yates</a> and is based on materials compiled by <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/directory/profiles/faculty/?uniquename=abbystew">Abby Stewart</a> for the University of Michiganâ€™s <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/advance/recruitment__stride_">STRIDE (Strategies and Tactics for Recruiting to Improve Diversity and Excellence) Committee</a>. There are a lot of links to interesting materials on the <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/advance/recruitment__stride_">STRIDE page</a> such as <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~advproj/Guidelines-for-Writing-Letters-of-Recommendation.pdf">guidelines about how to write a recommendation letter</a>, and discussion on the advancement of women in science careers. Here is the link to the slides...    <a href="http://blog.math.toronto.edu/colliand/files/2011/01/Faculty-diversity-training.pdf">FACULTY DIVERSITY TRAINING SLIDES.pdf</a>
