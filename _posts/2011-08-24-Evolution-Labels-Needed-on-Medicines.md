I was  born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas">El Paso</a>: I have a right to know! Parents of American kids have a right to know! Does the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">Theory of Evolution</a> have anything to do with our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medecine">medicines</a>? Which ones? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_Influenza">Flu shots?</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_evolution_in_cancer">Cancer treatments</a>?

Medicines which are designed based on the Theory of Evolution should have a visible disclosure label. Here are two suggestions for images that might be appropriate for the <strong>evolution disclosure label</strong>:

Some medicines which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_medicine">based on this scientific theory</a> are described on the <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/medicine_01">Evolution 101</a> website at the University of California at Berkeley.

Individuals not wishing to use medicines based on the Theory of Evolution should, naturally, have the right information available to select a different course of treatment. Believers in evolution will take comfort knowing their medicine is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a> (â€¦ <em>a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe</em>). We all have a right to know: <strong>Medicines should have evolution disclosure labels.</strong>
