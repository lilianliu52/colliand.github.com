I am a Professor of Mathematics at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/). I'm on academic leave from Toronto during 2014-2015 and will join the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/) in July, 2015. My research focuses on problems in partial differential equations using tools from harmonic analysis and dynamical systems.

I am the Founder/CEO of <a href="http://crowdmark.com">Crowdmark Inc.</a> Crowdmark builds tools that help teachers to teach and students to learn. Our first product is an online collaborative grading and analytics platform.
