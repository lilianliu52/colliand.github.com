<p><strong>A review of some results on a class of nonlocal nonlinear wave-type Cauchy problems</strong></p>

<p>A lot of the work here is inspired by the thesis of Nilay Duruk.
&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nonlocal Elasticity</li>
	<li>Examples</li>
	<li>Cauchy Problem</li>
	<li>Ongoing Studies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nonlocalnonlinearequation">Nonlocal nonlinear equation</h2>
<p><script type="math/tex">u_{tt}=[\beta*(u+g(u))]_x</script></p>

<p><script type="math/tex">0≤{\hat{\beta}}(\xi)≤C(1+\xi^2)^{-r/2}</script>
&lt;h2 id="examples"&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
Take $\beta=\delta,$ the Dirac measure. The equation becomes a more standard nonlinear equation.</p>

<p>Different choices of $\beta$ lead to different equations.
&lt;h2 id="cauchyproblem"&gt;Cauchy Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
The results identify conditions, usually involving smoothing assumptions on $\beta$, under which they obtain local well-posedenss results.</p>

<p>Global results are also obtained provided there is appropriate control in $L^\infty$.</p>

<p>How to get the $L^\infty$ control? If the integral of the nonlinearity is bounded from below by $-k u^2$ then we have a global solution.
&lt;h2 id="ongoingstudies"&gt;Ongoing Studies&lt;/h2&gt;
Obvious generalizations….2d case and efforts to generalize to equations which are <em>meaningful</em> in elasticity. We have also considered the <em>peridynamic</em> problem. This is a nonlocal generalization of the classical problems in elasticity which allows for tears and cracks.</p>

<p>Scattering? Small amplitude initial data? Travelling Waves?
&lt;h2 id="postlude"&gt;Postlude&lt;/h2&gt;
OK, so I discussed this further with H. Erbay. There are some issues with the linear problem. Let</p>

<p>$\Delta<em>\beta$ be the Fourier multiplier operator given by $-ξ^2 \beta(\xi )$. This collapses to the Laplacian when $\beta=1$. For the usual wave operator we have inhomogeneous smoothing of order 1 by the usual denominator games. However, for the wave operator corresponding to $\Delta</em>\beta$ we have smoothing by division by $\xi \beta(\xi)$. If $\beta(\xi)$ decays like $\xi^{-r}$ with $r&gt;2$ we lose the smoothing property and have new troubles.</p>

<p>In the discussion after the talk, E. Titi asked what they would do on a bounded domain. In this case, the convolution operator used to express the dynamics on the spatial side does not make sense near the boundary. Upon thinking about this a bit, it seems to me that a natural thing to do is to express the data in the basis of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the domain and then recast the dynamics as a multiplier operator in that basis. The issues of the domain are addressed then by the eigenfunctions and the nonlocal aspects near the boundary are resolved.</p>

<p>Taylor expansion in $\beta$ leads to higher order powers in $\xi$, which produces higher order derivative correction terms.
&lt;h2 id="cauchyproblem"&gt;Cauchy Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
Convert IVP into a Banach space valued ODE. Sobolev embedding. Algebra property of $H^s \cap L^\infty$. Convenient assumptions allow them to control the nonlinearity. (All this is done pointwise in time and the regularity is quite high.)</p>

<p>(My impression is that ideas from <span class="externalcitation"> (<a id="Kenig:1991p67" href="http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/FULLTEXT/1991/40/40003">Kenig-Ponce-Vega, Indiana Math Journal, </a></span><a id="Kenig:1991p67" href="http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/FULLTEXT/1991/40/40003">1991 vol. 40 (1) pp. 33-69</a><span class="externalcitation">)</span> could be used to prove Strichartz-type estimates adapted to this family of problems, under more precise assumptions on the decay of $\hat{\beta}$.</p>

<p>Blowup Alternative expressed in terms of $| Dw |<em>{L^\infty}$.
&lt;h2 id="conservationofenergyandglobalexistence"&gt;Conservation of Energy and Global Existence&lt;/h2&gt;
The energy involves a Fourier multiplier replacing the usual appearance of $\nabla$ in the kinetic energy. Under certain lower bound conditions on the potential energy, they can prove that a certain norm is bounded for all time which in turn controls the blowup alternative norm $|Dw|</em>{\infty}$.</p>

<p>Nonlocal coupled system of two fields each of the flavor flavor</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_{tt}=[\beta*(u+g(u))]_x</script>

<p>with assumptions that
<script type="math/tex">0≤\hat{\beta}(\xi)≤C(1+\xi^2)^{-r/2}.</script></p>

<p>Examples include certain coupled improved Boussinesq Equations. Such systems have been studied by Godefroy 1998 and Wang, Li (2009). The system models interaction of transverse waves in an elastic medium.</p>

<p>GWP and Blowup for a coupled system with $\beta = e^{-|x|}$ is open.
&lt;h2 id="lwp"&gt;LWP&lt;/h2&gt;
Local Lipschitz continuity of the right hand side of the system using pointwise in time estimates coming from Sobolev control of $L^\infty$.
&lt;h2 id="gwp"&gt;GWP&lt;/h2&gt;
Define an operator $P$ which plays the role of $\nabla$ in the energy depending upon $\beta$.</p>

<p>The nonlinearity for the system is assumed to arise from a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulation. Thus, we have a conserved energy. We then prove some Sobolev style bounds adapted to $Pu$ generalizing the case of $\nabla u$. With lower bounds on the potential energy, she obtains globalizing control.</p>

<p>Gronwall is used to show that the energy density stays bounded….
&lt;h2 id="blowup"&gt;Blowup&lt;/h2&gt;
Adaptation of the virial identity (following Godefroy 1998) shows that negative energy solutions explode.</p>

<p>(This strikes me as something that could be explored further from the generalized virial identity point of view.)
&lt;h2 id="postlude"&gt;Postlude&lt;/h2&gt;
I suggested that they look at the <a href="http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/FULLTEXT/1991/40/40003">KPV paper</a> and to try to imitate Morawetz-type calculations using the generalized virial identity.</p>

<h2 id="needforanewtheoryofsolidmechanics">Need for a new theory of solid mechanics</h2>
<p>For example, across a crack we have discontinuities across. We need a theory which replaces PDEs with integral equations. The peridynamic model was first proposed by Silling in 2000.
&lt;h2 id="peridynamicmodel"&gt;Peridynamic Model&lt;/h2&gt;
Classical elasticity</p>

<p>Peridynamic theory</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rho_0 u_tt = \int f(u(y,t) - u(x,t), y-x)dy</script>

<p>Newton’s third law demands that $f(η,ξ)=-f(-η,ξ)$. There are many studies on the modelling but there is relatively little mathematical analysis. Our aim is to study the nonlinear problem.
&lt;h2 id="lwp"&gt;LWP&lt;/h2&gt;
For convenience, we study $f(η,ξ)=β(ξ)g(η)$ where $\beta$ is even and $g$ is odd and $g(0)=0.$</p>

<p>Analysis in an appropriate space (pointwise in time tricks) leads to a LWP result. The treat the continuous and bounded case and the $C^1$ and bounded case. They also treat the $H^s \cap L^\infty$ case for all polynomial nonlinearities.

<p><strong>Thermal effects in gravitational Hartree systems</strong></p>

<p>(part of Ph.D thesis, joint w. Jean Dolbeaut and Christof Sparber)</p>

<p>Intersted in self-gravitating quantum particles. We represent this by density matrix operator. We are given a total mass of the system which is the integration of the occupation numbers over all occupation sites.</p>

<p>Energy is the kinetic energy of each state plus an interaction term described using the occupation number operators.</p>

<p>Variational problem corresponding to $H^1$ expressed in terms of the density matrices $\rho$.</p>

<p>The free energy is lower bounded by the kinetic energy using the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.</p>

<p>ack….the talk is dense and  fast for me to keep up this way, maybe even without trying to type but I like this stuff!.</p>

<p>Defines a notion of maximal temperature, which could perhaps be infinity. Minimizers satisfy an EL equation so we know more about them.</p>

<p>Compensated compactness leads to proof of existence of minimizers. Obital stability follows. Positivity of critical temperature for all $M&gt;0$. This extends a theorem of Lieb who showed the minimizer was a pure state when $T=0$ to the setting of $T \in [0, T_c]$. They have also found an explicit expression of the value of
$T_c$</p>

<p>Remarks for finite maximal temperature: For $\beta (s)=s^p$ with $p∈(1,7/5)$ , the maximal termperautre is finite.</p>

<p>Many other issues can be studied. Lots of open problems.</p>

<p>Cauchy problem is based on work of M. Colin, CPDE 27 (2002), 325-354. This is based on energy methods to overcome the loss of derivatives induced by the quasi-linear term, gauge transforms, ….</p>

<p>OPEN: Solve the local Cauchy problem under more general conditions on the nonlinearity and on the data. Look for global existence results.

<p><strong>Conservation equations for long wave models and applications to undular bores</strong></p>

<p>This is basically a modeling problem. There will not be a single proof in this.
(joint work with Al Fati Ali and Magnar Bjorkavag)</p>

<p><strong>Surface Waves</strong></p>

<p>Assume the fluid is incompressible, inviscid, two dimensional, irrotational, assumption that the wave does not overturn.</p>

<p>Euler equations, some boundary conditions at surface and at bottom. The LWP problem has been solved in just the last 10 years or so. Numerically, this is a difficult problem. The problem is often simplified by putting long wavelength or small amplitude assumptions.</p>

<p>Long wavelength gives the shallow water wave equations. Shallow water waves equation looks like a coupled system of Burger’s equations. There are an infinite number of conserved quantities in the shallow water wave equations.</p>

<p>Small amplitude case is known as the Airy theory. Rewrite Euler in terms of the velocity potential but you still have the boundary conditions. The pressure is removed. Linearize the Bernoulli equation on the boundary and calculate the dispersion formula by putting in plane waves. It emerges that $\omega^2=g k \tanh(h_0 k)$.</p>

<p>One can compare the dispersion relation for the KdV, BBM and water wave formulae. KdV is a bad model for water waves since</p>
