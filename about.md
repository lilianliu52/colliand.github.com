I am a Professor of [Mathematics](http://www.math.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/). My research focuses on problems in partial differential equations using tools from harmonic analysis and dynamical systems.

I am the Founder/CEO of <a href="http://crowdmark.com">Crowdmark Inc.</a> Crowdmark builds tools that help teachers to teach and students to learn. Our first product is an online collaborative grading platform.
