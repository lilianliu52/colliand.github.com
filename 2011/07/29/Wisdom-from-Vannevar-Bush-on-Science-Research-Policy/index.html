<p><strong>Timeless and timely extracts from<em> <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm">Science: The Endless Frontier</a></em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush:
</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Scientific Progress is Essential</strong></p>
<blockquote>Advances in science when put to practical use mean more  jobs, higher wages, shorter hours, more abundant crops, more leisure for  recreation, for study, for learning how to live without the<strong> </strong>deadening  drudgery which has been the burden of the common man for ages past.  Advances in science will also bring higher standards of living, will  lead to the prevention or cure of diseases, will promote conservation of  our limited national resources, and will assure means of defense  against aggression. But to achieve these objectives - to secure a high  level of employment, to maintain a position of world leadership - the  flow of new scientific knowledge must be both continuous and  substantial.

Moreover, since health, well-being, and security are proper concerns  of Government, scientific progress is, and must be, of vital interest to  Government. Without scientific progress the national health would  deteriorate; without scientific progress we could not hope for  improvement in our standard of living or for an increased number of jobs  for our citizens; and without scientific progress we could not have  maintained our liberties against tyranny.</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Importance of Basic Research</strong></p>
<blockquote>Basic research is performed without thought of practical  ends. It results in general knowledge and an understanding of nature and  its laws. This general knowledge provides the means of answering a  large number of important practical problems, though it may not give a  complete specific answer to any one of them. The function of applied  research is to provide such complete answers. The scientist doing basic  research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of  his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would  eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.

One of the peculiarities of basic science is the variety of paths  which lead to productive advance. Many of the most important discoveries  have come as a result of experiments undertaken with very different  purposes in mind. Statistically it is certain that important and highly  useful discoveries will result from some fraction of the undertakings in  basic science; but the results of any one particular investigation  cannot be predicted with accuracy. Basic research leads to new  knowledge. It provides scientific capital. It creates the fund from  which the practical applications of knowledge must be drawn. New  products and new processes do not appear full-grown. They are founded on  new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly  developed by research in the purest realms of science.

Today, it is truer than ever that basic research is the pacemaker of  technological progress. In the nineteenth century, Yankee mechanical  ingenuity, building largely upon the basic discoveries of European  scientists, could greatly advance the technical arts. Now the situation  is different. A nation which depends upon others for its new basic  scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in  its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical  skill.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Industrial Research</strong></p>
<blockquote>The simplest and most effective way in which the  Government can strengthen industrial research is to support basic  research and to develop scientific talent. The benefits of basic  research do not reach all industries equally or at the same speed. Some  small enterprises never receive any of the benefits. It has been  suggested that the benefits might be better utilized if “research  clinics” for such enterprises were to be established. Businessmen would  thus be able to make more use of research than they now do. This  proposal is certainly worthy of further study.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Remove the Barriers</strong></p>
<blockquote>Higher education in this country is largely for those who  have the means. If those who have the means coincided entirely with  those persons who have the talent we should not be squandering a part of  our higher education on those undeserving of it, nor neglecting great  talent among those who fail to attend college for economic reasons.  There are talented individuals in every segment of the population, but  with few exceptions those without the means of buying higher education  go without it. Here is a tremendous waste of the greatest resource of a  nation - the intelligence of its citizens.

If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune, is made to  determine who shall receive higher education in science, then we shall  be assured of constantly improving quality at every level of scientific  activity.</blockquote>
<p><strong>We must renew our scientific talent</strong></p>
<blockquote>The responsibility for the creation of new scientific  knowledge - and for most of its application - rests on that small body  of men and women who understand the fundamental laws of nature and are  skilled in the techniques of scientific research. We shall have rapid or  slow advance on any scientific frontier depending on the number of  highly qualified and trained scientists exploring it.</blockquote>
